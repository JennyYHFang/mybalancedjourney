# About Project 
I wanted to develop a fitness tracker so user can keep track of the exercise and meals. The tracker will assist user to realize what they did for the entire day and they can keep updating throughout the day. I want to make sure people are on track of their exercise and meals so they donâ€™t overeat or miss a workout. As a result, this project has helped me track my time and meals so I can lose some weight and develop my technical skills.
